        <p>My name is Kermalyn Prospere, but everyone calls me Kerma. I am originally from the island of St. Lucia located in the Caribbean Sea.<br> I am a computer science major. After graduating, I would like to attend graduate school. My ideal career path would be one <br> with an emphasis on Data Science. A job with company like Nissan in the development of connected cars with lower pollution emissions is my goal.<br> I live in East Providence and commute to Kingston every day. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and watching cooking shows.<br> Initially, I am very quiet and reserved with new individuals, but friendly and funny once you get to know me.
Apart from Computer Science, I am interested in Green energy.<br> Reducing carbon emissions is vital for the survival of our planet. All sectors have a part to play in the reduction of harmful pollutants. <br>Through use of new technology, the efficiency of producing products in the manufacturing industry has increased, but even more can be accomplished.<br>
I have taken a number of Math courses. MTH 141, 142, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus, and Discrete Math.</p>
