        <p>My name is Kermalyn Prospere, but everyone calls me Kerma. I am a majoring in Computer Science at the <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu"> University Of Rhode Island </a>. <br>
            After graduating, I would like to attend graduate school. My ideal career path would be one with an emphasis on Data Science. A job in the development<br> 
            of connected cars with lower pollution emissions would be ideal . Initially, I am very quiet and reserved with new individuals, but friendly and funny<br> once you get to know me.
            Apart from Computer Science, I am interested in Green energy. Reducing carbon emissions is vital for the survival of our planet. <br>
            All sectors have a part to play in the reduction of harmful pollutants. Through use of new technological methods, <br>
            the efficiency of producing products in the manufacturing industry has increased, but even more can be accomplished.<br>
