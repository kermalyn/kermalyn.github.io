        <p>My name is Kermalyn Prospere, but everyone calls me Kerma. I am originally from the island of St. Lucia located in the Caribbean Sea.<br> 
            I am a Computer Science Major at the <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu">. University Of Rhode Island </a>. After graduating, 
            I would like to attend graduate school. My ideal career path would be one <br> with an emphasis on Data Science. A job in the development 
            of connected cars with lower pollution emissions would be ideal .<br> I live in East Providence and commute to Kingston
            every day.<br> Initially, I am very quiet and reserved with new individuals, but friendly and funny once you get to know me.
            Apart from Computer Science, I am interested in Green energy.<br> Reducing carbon emissions is vital for the survival of our planet. 
            All sectors have a part to play in the reduction of harmful pollutants. <br>Through use of new technological methods, 
            the efficiency of producing products in the manufacturing industry has increased, but even more can be accomplished.<br>
